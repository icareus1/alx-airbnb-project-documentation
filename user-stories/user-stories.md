User Registration:
As an individual (either Guest or Host), I would like to register an account using my email and social accounts (Google, Facebook) in order to gain access and use the features of the platform in a safe manner. 

Profile Management:
As an individual (either Guest or Host), I would like to upload my profile photo, contact details and choose my preferences with the aim of personalizing my account and capturing my current information. 

Add Listings (Host Only):
As a host, I wish the guests can create Property listings and describe properties with information like title, description, the location, price, available amenities, and availability in order to get potential guests. 

Booking Creation (Guest Only):
As a guest, I would like to choose a property for certain dates and ensure that the property is not booked twice so that I can reliably arrange my visit. 

Payment Processing:
As a guest, I would like to securely pay for my bookings in advance, so as to assure my reservation, and as a host, I need to get my commission after a booking has been completed.
